Note: Level 1 (the level after loading screen): Make sure both players go in separate doorways, one player needs to rescue the other at the end of their trials.
Both players entering the same doorway will result in only 50% completion of the game and you will not be able to finish the game. Make sure the player completing
the ice trial gets frozen first before the player completing the fire trial hops onto the dragon to help ice player. 
When you have reached the endgame credits, press spacebar to restart. 

I implemented hashtables for item usage and character inventory. I used dllist for playerList. 

Challenge: I did the projectile challenge. At the final level when you have to defeat the ice boss, you hit the lever, creating a projectile spawning from the ceiling of
the map, hitting the ice boss.
